            Hi there! I'm a passionate and motivated student at <strong>Algonquin College</strong>, currently enrolled in the <em>Interactive Media Design</em> program.
          </p>

          <p>
            My interests revolve around <strong>web development</strong> and <strong>digital creativity</strong>. I enjoy building websites that not only work smoothly but also deliver an engaging and polished user experience. Some of my favorite technologies and tools include:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>HTML5, CSS3, and modern JavaScript (ES6+)</li>
            <li>JavaScript frameworks like <strong>Next.js</strong> and <strong>React</strong></li>
            <li>Responsive layouts using Flexbox and CSS Grid systems</li>
            <li>Version control and collaboration with Git & GitHub</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Apart from coding, I’m deeply interested in <strong>UI/UX design</strong>, interactive visuals, and motion design. I love experimenting with new design ideas and finding ways to blend visual aesthetics with functional interfaces.
          </p>

          <p>
            In my spare time, I work on personal web projects, practice design mockups, and follow the latest trends in front-end development. My goal is to pursue a career as a front-end developer or UI/UX designer, contributing to creative and forward-thinking teams.
          </p>

          <p>
            Thank you for checking out my portfolio! I’m eager to continue learning, improving my skills, and working on exciting digital experiences.
